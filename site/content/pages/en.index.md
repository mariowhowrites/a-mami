A-MAMI is a Peruvian based association that facilitates systemic changes in key areas of perinatal and nutritional care, with a special focus in lactation services. We empower and educate families in collaboration with Punoâ€™s local health institutions, nutrition and nursing programs at the local university as well as professional partners in the fields of obstetrics, psychology, lactation and pediatrics. 

Our center is one of a kind in the region, a model for practice and complementary resource to physician and hospital services for new mothers. The space also supports the local medical community with training to improve standards of care in local health facilities.  We provide educational sessions, lactation consultation and mother support groups for local families.  Our center also offers access to resources and products that foster and improve breastfeeding practices as well as interventions to fight infant malnutrition in the region of Puno.

A-MAMI advocates and educates locally for the implementation of existing laws to support working mothers in public and private sector employment to ensure their rights to breastfeed.
