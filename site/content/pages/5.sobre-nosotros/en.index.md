Our objective is to facilitate systemic changes in key areas of care and consultation for mothers and infants, aiming to empower and educate families in collaboration with Puno’s local health institutions, nutrition and nursing programs at the local university and professional partners in the fields of obstetrics, psychology, lactation and pediatrics. We provide training and educational sessions, lactation consultation and access to resources and products that foster and promote breastfeeding practices and interventions to fight infant malnutrition in the region of Puno.

The center is one of a kind in the region, a model of practice and complementary resource to doctor/hospital visits for new mothers. The space also supports the local medical community with training and consultation to improve standards of care in local health facilities.

A-MAMI also advocates and educates in the city for the implementation of existing laws to support working mothers in public and private sector employment to ensure their rights to breastfeed.

### Vision:

An educated, supportive community of mothers, equipped with the resources and knowledge to provide the best nutritional choices to their infant.  A technically skilled and compassionately collaborative medical population willing and able to provide the best practices in breastfeeding and maternity care.

### Philosophy:

Every mother should be empowered to actively engage in her maternity experience and make decisions that are best for her and her family.
